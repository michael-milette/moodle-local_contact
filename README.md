# Usage

Before getting started:

* Ensure email settings are properly configured in Moodle.

## Creating a new form

This plugin is for administrators with a little knowledge of HTML forms. You can simply copy and paste any of the [examples from the Wiki](https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle-local_contact/wiki/HTML-Form-Templates) to get started.

To create a new web form on your site, start by adding a Moodle page or HTML block. Be sure to switch to the Source Code view button in the Moodle Atto WYSIWYG editor before entering or pasting HTML code similar to the following:

    <form action="../../local/contact/index.php" method="post" class="contact-us">
        <fieldset>
            <label for="name" id="namelabel">Your name <strong class="required">(required)</strong></label><br>
            <input id="name" name="name" type="text" size="57" maxlength="45" pattern="[A-zÀ-ž]([A-zÀ-ž\s]){2,}"
                    title="Minimum 3 letters/spaces." required="required" value=""><br>
            <label for="email" id="emaillabel">Email address <strong class="required">(required)</strong></label><br>
            <input id="email" name="email" type="email" size="57" maxlength="60" required="required" value=""><br>
            <label for="subject" id="subjectlabel">Subject <strong class="required">(required)</strong></label><br>
            <input id="subject" name="subject" type="text" size="57" maxlength="80" minlength="5"
                    title="Minimum 5 characters." required="required"><br>
            <label for="message" id="messagelabel">Message <strong class="required">(required)</strong></label><br>
            <textarea id="message" name="message" rows="5" cols="58" minlength="5"
                    title="Minimum 5 characters." required="required"></textarea><br>
            <input type="hidden" id="sesskey" name="sesskey" value="">
            <script>document.getElementById('sesskey').value = M.cfg.sesskey;</script>
        </fieldset>
        <div>
            <input type="submit" name="submit" id="submit" value="Send">
        </div>
    </form>

That is it. Just save and you are done.

Note: If you are putting the form into a block, you will need to adjust the "../.." part in the action of the form so that it is relative to the webroot of your Moodle website. If you are using the FilterCodes plugin, you can simply use {wwwroot} and it will work anywhere you put the form whether it is in a page or a block.

Example:

    <form action="{wwwroot}/local/contact/index.php" method="post" class="contact-us">
    :       :       :       :       :

To see a full example of the above form, see [Contact Us with FilterCodes example](https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle-local_contact/wiki/HTML-Form-Templates#user-content-contact-us-form-with-filtercodes-for-contact-form-for-moodle).

### Customizing the form

You can customize your form to suit your particular requirements. You will need to be familiar with how to create basic HTML5 web forms. If you are not, take a look at the [HTML5 Forms tutorial](http://www.html5-tutorials.org/forms/introduction/).

Almost any type of HTML field included with the form should automatically appear in the email. Example: text, password, textarea, radio, checkbox, select drop-down, hidden and more. See the section on [Limitations](#limitations).

In the previous example, the form's class "contact-us" is not required but is simply included to help you to apply CSS styling to the form. Feel free to change it to anything you like.

**REQUIRED FIELDS:** The following input fields are required in order to avoid the built-in anti-spam protection. If these input fields are not present in the form, it will not work:

1. **name** - You can create an alias for this field name by editing the **field-name** string in the Moodle language editor. If user is logged in, this field will be ignored and the users full name as registered in Moodle will be used instead. If the user is currently logged in (not guest), this field will be ignored if it exists and user profile info (firstname lastname) will be used instead.
2. **email** - You can create an alias for this field name by editing the **field-email** string in the Moodle language editor. If the user is currently logged in (not guest), this field will be ignored if it exists and user profile info (firstname lastname) will be used instead.
3. **sesskey** - Must include both the hidden **sesskey** field as well as the SCRIPT line below it.
4. **submit** - The name of the button.

Your FORM tag must have an action set to **../../local/contact/index.php** and a method set to **post**.

**OPTIONAL FIELDS:** Although not required, the following fields have special meaning to Contact Form:

* **subject**  : If you want the subject of the email to contain content from the submitted web form, your form must include a field called **subject**. You can create an alias for this field name by editing the **field-subject** string in the Moodle language editor.
* **message**  : If you want a textarea field, like a Message field, to be formatted properly when inserted in the email, the field must be called **message**. You can create an alias for this field name by editing the **field-message** string in the Moodle language editor.
* **recipient**: Add this field if you want to specify a recipient other than the Moodle support email address. This field must contain an alias, not an email address. See the section on Configuring the List of Recipients in this documentation.

You can also add the referring URL, the page that the user was on before going to the form, by adding the following to your form:

    <input type="hidden" id="referrer" name="referrer" value="">
    <script>document.getElementById('referrer').value = document.referrer;</script>

#### Additional tips

If you want to insert spaces in your field names, use underscores "_" in your form field id and name. Contact Form for Moodle will replace these with a space before inserting the field name into the email message.

Field id/name tokens must begin with a letter. They may optionally also contain any combination of letters (a-z), numbers (0-9), underscores, dashes, periods and colons (_-.:). They are not case sensitive.

## Configuring the email message

At the moment, you will need to edit the language files in order to modify the messages which will be sent to the user.

The message can include the following tags which will be substituted at the time the message is sent:

* **[fromemail]**      : User's email address as entered in the web form or the users registered email address if logged in.
* **[fromname]**       : User's name as entered in the web form or the users registered first and last name if logged in.
* **[http_referer]**   : URL of the web form page that the email was generated from.
* **[http_user_agent]**: Web browser.
* **[lang]**           : Language that the user was viewing the website in at the time they submitted the form.
* **[sitefullname]**   : Site's fullname.
* **[siteshortname]**  : Site's short name.
* **[siteurl]**        : URL of the website.
* **[supportemail]**   : Site's support email address.
* **[supportname]**    : Site's support name.
* **[userip]**         : Best attempt to determine the user's IP address. Will be the firewall address if they are behind one.
* **[userstatus]**     : Displays the user's current status if they are known to the Moodle site, either because they are logged in or by their email address.

Note that, in the future, the email message will be configurable from within the plugin's settings.

## Optional Contact Form for Moodle settings

Contact Form for Moodle includes the following settings. These are available on the plugin's `Settings` page by going to:

Site administration > Plugins > Local plugins > Contact Form

### Configuring the List of Recipients

By default, messages sent from the Contact Form for Moodle will be delivered to your Moodle support contact email address. However, you can optionally specify a different recipient on a per form basis. Configuring this requires two additional easy steps:

#### Step 1 - Create the List of Available Recipients

Start by specifying a List of Available Recipients in the plugin's settings.

The format for each recipient is alias|emailaddress|name. You should only enter one recipient per line. Incorrectly entered lines and blank lines will be ignored.

For example:

    tech support|support@example.com|Joe Fixit
    webmaster|admin@example.com|Mr. Moodle
    electrical|nikola.tesla@example.com|Nikola
    history|charles.darwin@example.com|Mr. Darwin
    law|issac.newton@example.com|Isaac Newton
    math|galileo.galilei@example.com|Galileo
    english|mark.twain@example.com|Mark Twain
    physics|albert.einstein@example.com|Albert
    science|thomas.edison@example.com|Mr. Edison
    philosophy|aristotle@example.com|Aristotle

Note that this list is not automatically populated in forms. You will need to do that manually in the next step.

#### Step 2 - Add a field to your form.

Single Recipient - This can be done by specifying the recipient's alias in a "hidden" type input field in your form. For example:

    <input type="hidden" name="recipient" id="recipient" value="webmaster">

One of Many Recipients - You can also create a drop-down (select) list in your form and have the user specify the recipient. For example:

    <select name="recipient" id="recipient" required>
        <option value="">Please select...</option>
        <option value="tech support">Technical support</option>
        <option value="webmaster">Moodle administrator</option>
    </select>

A different form on the same site might have:

    <select name="recipient" id="recipient" required>
        <option value="">Please select...</option>
        <option value="history">History teacher</option>
        <option value="math">Math teacher</option>
        <option value="english">English teacher</option>
        <option value="philosophy">Philosophy teacher</option>
    </select>

Notice that you can include any number of recipients in your form's drop-down list. You need not include all of them. If a specified alias is not in the List of Available Recipients, the email message will default to being delivered to the Moodle site's support email address.

### Configuring ReCAPTCHAs

Note: If Moodle's ReCAPTCHA is not configured, you will not see this setting.

To use ReCAPTCHA in your Contact form, you must:

- Configure Moodle's ReCAPTCHA settings. See Site administration > Plugins > Authentication > Manage authentication. These settings are near the bottom of the page.
- Install and enable the [filter_filtercodes](https://moodle.org/plugins/filter_filtercodes) plugin.
- Add the {recaptcha} tag inside your form, usually right before the `Send` button. This will be converted into HTML code when your form is displayed. For more information on inserting a {recaptha} tag, see the [FilterCodes documentation](https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle-filter_filtercodes#usage).

However, even if ReCAPTCHA is enabled, you can tell Contact Form for Moodle not to use it. Just go into the settings for Contact Form, check the box for `No ReCAPTCHA` and save. In this case, you will not need to include the {recaptcha} tag in the form. Example:

    <form action="../../local/contact/index.php" method="post" class="template-form">
        <fieldset>
            <label for="name" id="namelabel">Your name <strong class="required">(required)</strong></label><br>
            <input id="name" name="name" type="text" pattern="[A-zÀ-ž]([A-zÀ-ž\s]){2,}" title="Minimum 3 letters/spaces." required="required" value="" style="width:100%;"><br>
            <label for="email" id="emaillabel">Email address <strong class="required">(required)</strong></label><br>
            <input id="email" name="email" type="email" required="required" value="" style="width:100%;"><br>
            <input type="hidden" id="sesskey" name="sesskey" value="">
            <script>document.getElementById('sesskey').value = M.cfg.sesskey;</script>
            **{recaptcha}**
        </fieldset>
        <div>
            <input type="submit" name="submit" id="submit" value="Send">
        </div>
    </form>

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

### Requiring login

The `Require login` setting requires that users be logged-in in order to be able to submit the form. If a form is submitted and the user is not logged-in they will be redirected and informed. If you require users to be logged-in, it is also highly recommended that you also place your form on a page which is only accessible to logged-in users. Guest users are not considered to be logged-in.
 

# Updating

There are no special considerations required for updating the plugin.

The first public BETA version was released on 2016-12-05. For more information on releases since then, see
[CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle-local_contact/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

# Uninstallation

Uninstalling the plugin by going into the following:

Home > Administration > Site Administration > Plugins > Manage plugins > Contact Form

...and click Uninstall. You may also need to manually delete the following folder:

    /local/contact

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

# Limitations

This is not a form builder.

The plugin doesn't currently properly support more than one textarea type fields. Additional textareas will still work however they won't be formatted as nice.

Any HTML entered will be escaped. You cannot use any kind of HTML formatting or markup/markdown other than pressing ENTER at the end of a paragraph.

You cannot configure the Contact Form email processor on a per form basis. All contact forms on your site will share:

* The message that is displayed to the user after the message has been sent.
* The footer of the email containing additional user information.
* Enabling/disabling of the autoresponder.
* The autoresponder message (if enabled).

Web forms are limited to 1024 fields including hidden fields and the submit button. Total size of the submission may not exceed 256 KB.

There is no support file attachments type fields or form-data encoded as "multipart/form-data".

# FAQ

## Answers to frequently asked questions

### How do I make this form available to everyone, even if they are not logged in?

Add a page or block to your Moodle Frontpage. Edit the content and paste in your HTML form source code. Make sure that the WYSIWYG editor is in HTML mode.

Since you don't need to be logged into your Moodle Frontpage to see it, your form will also be accessible to visitors to your site who are logged-out, logged-in as a guest as well as to regular logged-in users. If this option is not available to you, the process is a little more complicated as it involves making a course available to guests and having Moodle automatically logged them in as guests.

### All I see is the word "Forbidden" or a blank screen after submitting a form. What should I do?

Although this plugin is still in BETA, has been tested pretty extensively. If you are getting this error, it is likely that your will need to fix your form and/or enable Moodle debugging. Alternatively you can try the form logged in as a Moodle administrator. This will enable the display of additional diagnostic information.

### Where do emails go when they are submitted on my Moodle website?

Emails are sent to the Support Email address. Logged in as a Moodle administrator, you can find out the email address by going to:

Administration > Site Administration > Server > Support Contact

If the field is empty, take note of the indicated default email address.

### Why are emails submitted on my Moodle website not being delivered?

Make sure Moodle email is working. We recommend test your Moodle email system using the eMailTest plugin:

  https://moodle.org/plugins/local_mailtest

### My site successfully completed the eMailTest process. Why is it still not working?

If you still can't get your web form to work, the problem might be your form. Try using HTML sample form included in the [Usage](#usage) section. Then customize it to meet your needs.

### I am still getting a lot of spam emails through my web form. Can I block certain IP addresses?

There are a couple of ways you can blacklist an IP address. The best way is to add them to your web server settings. Consult your web server documentation for more information. If you don't have access to those settings, Moodle Administrators can add the IP addresses to the Moodle IP Blocker settings. For more information, see:

  https://docs.moodle.org/34/en/IP_blocker

### Why does the User's IP address ([userip]) says "::1" or 0:0:0:0:0:1 instead showing a real IP address when I receive an email submitted from the form?

::1 and 0:0:0:0:0:1 are the equivalent of 127.0.0.1 (localhost). This should only happen if your web browser is on the same computer as the web server. Otherwise you should be seeing a real IP address.

### Can I include my favourite captcha in a form?

No. Only Moodle's ReCAPTCHA will work. See the [Usage](#usage) section for more information.

### Moodle's ReCAPTCHA is enabled. Do I need to use it in my Contact forms?

It is not required. However, if you don't want to use it, you must check the `No ReCAPTCHA` checkbox in the plugin's settings.

### Can I add a check box that must be checked, like for accepting the privacy policy, before the user can submit the form?

Absolutely. Information on how to do this will be coming in the future. (Hint: It requires a JavaScript code snippet)

### I have a multilingual Moodle site. Why does the form works in one language but not in the other?

Each language file defines the names of the fields for your form. To make a form work for all languages, change the name of this fields for each language by editing the "field-" strings in the Moodle language editor so that they are all the same ones you used in your form).

### How can I change the names of the fields that appear in the email?

In your form, change the value of "label for=" to the word you want. On the next line, change the id= and the name= to be the same as the one for the "label for=". Finally, if the field was "name", "email", "subject" or "message", you will also need to edit the related "field-*" string in the Moodle language editor.

### What types of web forms should not be implemented using Contact Form?

This plugin is not suitable for any form whose data should not end up in an email inbox. For example, Moodle natively supports several excellent types of forms processors such as Feedback, Survey and Database. Unless your e-commerce solution involves low volume semi-manual process, this could be better handled by applications designed with this in mind. Signing up for mailing list subscriptions should be done through a service such as Aweber, Constant Contact, MailChimp and other similar services.

Note: The mention of any 3rd party product other than Moodle and FilterCodes is not meant as an endorsement or recommendation. They are simply provided as examples.

### How can I make the form only available to logged-in users?

To only display your form for logged-in users, ensure that it is on a Moodle page that is only viewable by logged-in users. User access to pages and blocks is controlled by Moodle, not by this plugin. With that in mind, if you don't include a name and email address field in your form, only registered users who are logged-in to the Moodle site will be able to submit the form. Another option is to use the {if...}{/if...} conditional tags in the FilterCodes plugin to control who can see the form.

### Why is the name and/or email address I entered in a form getting changed when submitted?

This only happens if a user is logged in. In this case, their registered first and last name and email address will be used instead of the name and email address entered in a form.

### How can I include user profile fields in the email footer and confirmation email message?

Yes. Many but not all profile fields are available by inserting [FilterCodes](https://moodle.org/plugins/filter_filtercodes/) tags.

### Are there any security considerations?

There are no known security considerations at this time.
